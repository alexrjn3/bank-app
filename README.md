The application is an interactive banking system developed in JavaScript, allowing users to manage multiple accounts, make transfers, request and repay loans, and view real-time transactions.
Users can log in using a username and PIN, gaining access to a personalized dashboard that displays their balance, transaction history, and updated financial information.

This project was originally developed as part of a JavaScript Udemy course, but I implemented several additional features beyond the course material:
- Created a custom user system (person1, person2, person3) with extended fields such as transfer_premium, available_loan, loans, and more.
- Added a transfer limit for non-premium users (maximum â‚¬3000).
- Implemented a complete loan system, including loan requests, repayments, interest calculation, and a dropdown for selecting loan types.
- Introduced an automatic 10-minute logout timer for enhanced security.
- Designed a visual transaction history, featuring colored cards, operation types, dates, and formatted amounts.
- Implemented account closure with confirmation, requiring user/PIN verification and actual account deletion.
- Made the entire application responsive for mobile devices.
